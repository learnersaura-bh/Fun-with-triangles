# make-Geometry-easy
This repo is about geometrical figures
This project is all about triangles and how well do you know about triasngles.
This project is divided into three parts:
(1)  Triangles have three angles but these can't be any random angles. therefore first part tells you if your three input angles makes a triangle or not.
(2) second Part of project comprise of quiz which contains some easy questions related to triangles. and you can also know your score after you submit your responses.
(3) A right angle triangle have three distinct sides and has an inter relation which helps us to calculate one side if two of them are known. so this part enables you to calculate hypotenuse.
